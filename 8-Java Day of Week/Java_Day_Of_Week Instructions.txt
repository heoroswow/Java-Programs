Java Day Of Week
Problem description
Problem taken from "Introduction to Programming in Java" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

Write a program DayOfWeek.java that takes a date as input from the command line arguments and prints the day of the week that date falls on. Your program should take three command-line arguments: m (month), d (day), and y (year). For m use 1 for January, 2 for February, and so forth. For output print 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so forth. Use the following formulas, for the Gregorian calendar:

    y0 = y - (14 - m) / 12
    x = y0 + y0/4 - y0/100 + y0/400
    m0 = m + 12 * ((14 - m) / 12) - 2
    d0 = (d + x + (31*m0)/ 12) mod 7
For example, on what day of the week was August 2, 1953?
    y = 1953 - 0 = 1953
    x = 1953 + 1953/4 - 1953/100 + 1953/400 = 2426
    m = 8 + 12*0 - 2 = 6
    d = (2 + 2426 + (31*6) / 12) mod 7 = 2443 mod 7 = 0  (Sunday)
Compiling and Running
You can type the following commands to compile and run your program from a terminal or select build/compiler from your IDE (e.g: IntelliJ IDEA):
javac DayOfWeek.java 
To run the the program, select run and set the command line arguments (e.g: 8 2 1953) as mentioned in class. If you use DOS cmd or terminal, you can type a command similar to the following:
java DayOfWeek 8 2 1953 
Output format
The program output should be printed exactly as the following to recieve full credits:
8 2 1953 falls on 0.
