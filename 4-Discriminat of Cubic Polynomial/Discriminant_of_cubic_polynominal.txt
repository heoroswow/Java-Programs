Discriminant of cubic polynomial
Problem taken from "Introduction to Programming in Java" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

Write a java program that takes three decimal values b, c, and d from the command line. These values determine the coefficients of the cubic polynomial x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. Your task is to write an expression to compute the discriminant b^2c^2 - 4c^3 - 4b^3d - 27d^2 + 18bcd and output the result.

Here is an example how your program will be tested:
    java Discriminant 2.5 3.0 7.0
Output format
The program output should be printed to two decimal places. Here is the output of the above run:
The discriminant of the polynomial x^3 + 2.50x^2 + 3.00x + 7.00 is -867.25
